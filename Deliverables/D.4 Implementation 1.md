# D.4 Implementation 1

For this deliverable, you should have a fully functional piece of software that delivers a set of features (donâ€™t need to be the complete set, but it needs to be a working prototype). Structure your deliverable according to the following sections. See the Team Project Instructions for details about formatting. 

## 1. Introduction

Provide a short paragraph that describes your system. This paragraph should contain the value proposition and a description of the main features of the software. At the end of the introduction, include a link to your project on GitHub.

Grading criteria (1 point): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness, thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language. The description should be consistent with the current state of the project. You should include the link to GitHub.

## 2. Implemented requirements

List in this section, the requirements and associated pull request that you implemented for this release, following the example below---include the description of the requirement, a link to the issue, a link to the pull request(s) that implement the requirement, who implemented the requirement, who approved it, and a print screen that depicts the implemented feature (if applicable). I expect that you implement the features you specified in your MVP (c.f. D.2 Requirements). 

Order the requirements below by the name of the student who implemented them. All the members of the group should have worked on implementation activities and submitted pull requests. Only stable code should be included in the release. The code that is still under development should be in branches. See the example:

# Example of Requirement Description
Requirement: As a Student, I want to add a homework assignment so that I can organize my ToDo list.

Issue: <link to your GitHub issue>

Pull request: https://github.com/fake-user/project/pull/426Links to an external site.

Implemented by: Martin Fowler

Approved by: Ada Lovelace

Print screen: A print screen that depicts the implemented feature (if applicable)

All source code should be submitted by means of pull requests and the scrum master in the team should review and approve each pull request. For more information about pull requests: https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/Links to an external site.  

Grading criteria (10 points): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness, thoroughness, consistency, coherence, adequate use of language, and amount of work put into the implementation. Students can receive different grades depending on their involvement. It is expected that all members contribute with non-trivial implementation. All pull requests should be approved and integrated by the scrum master. You should follow an adequate workflow (description of the requirement on the issue tracker, submission of the implemented requirement as a pull request, and review of the pull request by another developer). 

## 3. Tests
You should implement automated tests that aim to verify the correct behavior of your code. Provide the following information:

1.Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.)

1.Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located
1.An example of a test case. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test
1.A print screen showing the result of the execution of the automated tests

Grading criteria (4 points): You should have an adequate number of automated tests. They should be well-written to exercise the main components of your system, covering the relevant inputs.

## 4. Adopted technologies
List the adopted technologies with a brief description and justification for choosing them.

Grading criteria (1 point): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness, thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language.

## 5. Learning/training
Describe the strategies employed by the team to learn the adopted technologies. 

Grading criteria (1 point): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness, thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language.

## 6. Deployment
Provide a link for the system in production and describe how you are deploying your system. 

Some alternatives for deploying your system in the cloud: 

AWS. AWS Educate offers free credits for students. See the tutorial at https://docker-curriculum.com/Links to an external site. on how to create a container and deploy it on AWS. 
Digital Ocean or Azure. As part of the GitHub Education benefits, as a student, you can get $100 at Digital Ocean and $100 at Microsoft Azure cloud computing platforms (see more details at https://education.github.com/studentsLinks to an external site.).
Oracle Cloud. Oracle offers a free tier in its cloud environment that should be more than enough for your needs.
Firebase. Firebase can be a good choice if you are building a mobile phone app. 
 Grading criteria (3 points): This section will be graded based on the adequate use of the technology and its adequate description.

## 7. Licensing
Inform the license you adopted for your source code (remember to configure GitHub accordingly). Explain why you adopted this license. For more information, check https://choosealicense.com/Links to an external site..

Grading criteria (1 point): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness, thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language.

## 8. README File
You should also prepare your repository for receiving new contributors. You should prepare a README.md file. See an example at https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2Links to an external site.. In the README file, the current version should be stated. You should follow the Semantic VersioningLinks to an external site. schema. Tag the GitHub repository accordingly (see Git Basics TaggingLinks to an external site.). 

Your repository should contain a CONTRIBUTING.md file, a LICENSE file, and a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file. Search online for some examples of these files. In this section of the deliverable, put links to these files on GitHub.

Grading criteria (3 points): This section will be based on the presence and quality of the information presented in the files.

## 9. Look & feel
Describe the approach you adopted to design your user interface. Include some screenshots.

Grading criteria (3 points): This section will be graded based on the appearance (aesthetics) and usability (ease of use) of the system.

## 10. Lessons learned
In retrospective, describe what your team learned during this first release and what you are planning to change for the second release. 

Grading criteria (2 points): Adequate reflection about problems and solutions, clear description with adequate use of language. 

## 11. Demo
Include a link to a video showing the system working.

Grading criteria (6 points): This section will be graded based on the quality of the video and on the evidence that the features are running as expected. Additional criteria are the relevance of the demonstrated functionalities, the correctness of the functionalities, and the quality of the developed system from the external point of view (user interface).
