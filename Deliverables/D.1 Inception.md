INTRODUCTIONS
-------------
      Instructions:
      describe in one paragraph what your project is about. Make it clear what problem your software is solving and the context of the solution.
      GRADING CRITERIA (5 points): Your paragraph should be well written in formal language and must contain all the required information. Be clear, concise, and check for typos and grammar errors. 


RNT-A-ROOM focuses on comfort and safety for our Travel Nurses. Housing options are tailored for them and their professions. With our security processing system, only allowing travel nurses access to our resources gives both landlords and travel nurses the ease of mind when working with one another. We strive to give high-quality housing selection services to make housing the last thing you need to work about during your travel to help heal our country. 


INITIAL VALUE PROPOSITION & CUSTOMER SEGMENT
---------------------------------------------
      Instructions: 
      report the initial guesses for the (i) value proposition and (ii) customer segment. The value proposition should make clear what your product is, the target customer, the value you provide, and why your product is unique. See examples on the lecture slides.
      GRADING CRITERIA (5 points): The value proposition should make clear the value from the point of view of the customer. It should not be a slogan or a description of functionality. The value proposition and consumer segment should be coherent with the text in the previous section---in particular, the value should address the problem reported above (problem-solution fit). The customer segment should not be too broad or too specific. 

Initial Value Proposition
-------------------------
RNT-A-ROOM is a web-based service that will help travel nurses find housing in the United States.
Audience: Travel Nurses located in the States
Value: Offer ease of mind and safety by providing an easy-to-use browser-based service that will check for Travel Nurse users and certified housing options
What makes us different: Checking for credentials and legitimacy for both renters and landlords

RNT-A-ROOM offers a web-based service that is tailored to the needs of travel nurses seeking housing in the United States. This will offer ease of mind and safety for our travel nurses by offering an easy-to-use platform that verifies both the users and the housing options available. 


Customer Segment
----------------
Our audience is travel nurses with housing needs in the United States. Travel nurses have specific housing needs such as:
- flexible leases (short term, long term)
- family and pet accommodations
- safety and security (they will be staying in unfamiliar locations)
- proximity to healthcare facilities
By targeting this audience, RNT-A-ROOM can focus its services on meeting the unique requirements of travel nurses, which in turn will provide value and address their specific plan.
